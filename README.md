> **L**et's **L**earn about **J**ava **S**cript, HTML and CSS.

In this project I learn about Front-End Development by practising with
some projects for beginners.
All the content will be based on [freeCodeCamp's article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-build-a-quiz-app-with-react-and-typescript) providing some project ideas.

## Project-List

### 1. A simple website
A quick look at html and css to understand how the work again.

### 2. Color Flipper
A website allowing the user to change the background color to a random color by the click of the button.

### 3. Counter Strikes
A little counter with 3 buttons and a simple objective: Reach a certain number.
Very fun concept, someone should make a game about this with cookies or something...
